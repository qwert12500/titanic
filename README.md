# titanic
This is the famous titanic dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This jupyter notebook is one of the solution, using majority voting for 5 different tuned machine learning model. Also hyperparameter tuning is used alongside with Nested Cross Validation for the best practice. Extensive feature engineering such as extracting family relationship from the names are also utilized.

Finally the model achieves a 82% of test data accuracy, which is top 1% performance among all submissions in Kaggle.
